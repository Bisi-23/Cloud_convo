When the sun shines
People come out to have fun
But when the wether is foggy
People tend to be lazy and indoor.

In the early years,
man has always been crude and raw,
especially,
in relating with their environment.

But as time passes by,
Man has improvised a better way.
From been undeveloped to developed
This explain the birth of mordernization.
